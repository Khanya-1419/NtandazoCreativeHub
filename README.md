This is a personal developer portfolio built using ASP.NET Core MVC with .NET 8, C#, Bootstrap, and custom CSS. It showcases my skills, background, and work experience in a clean, colorful, and responsive layout. Iâ€™ve included smooth animations, lively buttons, and flying text effects to give the site a modern and creative feel. The portfolio highlights my background in ICT Business Analysis, experience with SQL and C#, and previous IT work at a municipality in the West Rand. It includes sections like About Me, Projects, and Contact, and is designed to reflect both my backend development strengths and my interest in continuous learning and growth in the tech space.
